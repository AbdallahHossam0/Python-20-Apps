# Funky File Utilities Repository 🎉

As programmers, We don't use winrar we make it ^^

This repository contains two groovy applications: the File Extractor and the File Zipper. 📁🔧

## File Extractor 📂

Extract those files like a pro! This rad GUI app allows you to select an archive and a directory, and then effortlessly extracts the contents of the archive into the chosen directory. It's as easy as 1-2-3! 🚀

To run the File Extractor, simply execute the `main.py` script, and a cool window will pop up. Choose the archive you want to extract, select the destination directory, hit the "Extract" button, and boom! The extraction process will begin. 🧨

## File Zipper 💥

Compress your files with style! This awesome GUI app lets you select multiple files and a destination folder, and then magically zips them up into a single compressed file. It's like creating a file sandwich! 🥪

To use the File Zipper, run the `main.py` script, and a snazzy window will appear. Enter the paths of the files you want to compress, choose the folder where you want to save the compressed file, click the "Compress" button, and voilà! Your files will be compressed into a groovy zip file. 🎒
